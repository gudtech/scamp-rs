# Code of Conduct

The scamp-rs contributing team is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone. Participants are responsible for maintaining the highest standard of ethics and conduct.

## Human Dignity
Participants shall not dimininish the dignity or erase the identity of any person through language, rethorical device, or any other means.
Diminution includes, but is not limited to:

* Referring to any person using terminology which marginalizes them or their group.
* Describing any person, present or otherwise using language which is mocking or derisive of another group
* Participants shall endeavor to express their feelings in an emotionally-intelligent manner whenever possible. We each have agency over our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. Take the time to understand the difference between these and objective reality, especially when Communicating with other participants.

## Exercise Emotional Intelligence By:

Making "I feel" statements, especially in times of frustration or stress.
Describing internal perceptions and emotions rather than misrepresenting them as objective facts.
Make an effort to qualify statements as being from your perspective – "In my view", "I suspect", or make an "I feel" statement.

## Reporting:

If you are being harassed by a member of the scamp-rs contributing team, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the repository managing contributors, or the güdTECH opensource administrative team at foss@gudtech.com. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to all scamp-rs contributors and users, in all project related venues and communications online and offline. If you are being harassed by a member of the scamp-rs contributing team outside these spaces, we still want to know about it. We commit to taking all good-faith reports of harassment seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The managing contributors reserve the right to exclude people from the scamp-rs contributing team based on their past behavior, including behavior outside the scamp-rs contributing team spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the scamp-rs contributing team.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the scamp-rs contributing team members or the general public. We will not ever name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
